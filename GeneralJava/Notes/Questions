1. can we have a return type for the constructor ?
No, the constructor can not have a return type. If the constructor has a return
type it will become a normal function

2. Can you make a constructor final ?
No, we cannot make a constructor final because - a final method in java is 
to do not allow override in the inherited class.

But the constructor is not inherited in java.

So there is no need of having a final for the constructor.
